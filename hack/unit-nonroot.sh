# Run the unit stage as a user who cannot write to /.

# Twice now a unit test passed "/cache", "/clone" or "/register" straight into
# code that creates a directory or a lock file. Both were green here and both
# failed on a colleague's machine. The difference was not the code. It was that
# this container runs as root, and root can write to /.
#
# A grep cannot tell those two lines apart from the hundred correct ones. A
# literal path handed to a mocked runner touches nothing and is fine; the same
# literal handed to real code creates a directory at the root of the machine.
# Running the tests as somebody who cannot write to / tells them apart exactly,
# with no allowlist and no heuristic.
